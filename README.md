# Triggering-Effect-Models
functions_st.cpp includes definitions of functions for self-triggering models (single event type).
functions_ct.cpp includes definitions of functions for competing-triggering models (multiple event types).
In each of the .cpp files, code for generating data, calculating partial likelihood, gradient and Hessian matrices are provided.

Folder Table1 includes simulation code (main.R for generation, analysis.R for creating summary tables) and simulation results (.RData, created by clusters) for simulating self-triggering models (Table 1 in the paper).
Folder Table2 includes simulation code (main.R for generation, analysis.R for creating summary tables) and simulation results (.RData, created by clusters) for simulating competing-triggering models (Table 2 in the paper).

Data, code and results for Li-Fraumeni syndrome analysis are not available due to data safety concerns.
